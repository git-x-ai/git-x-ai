## 🎨 Design Philosophy

I believe that great software should be:

- **Beautiful** - Aesthetics matter. Users should enjoy using your application.
- **Intuitive** - Interfaces should be self-explanatory and easy to navigate.
- **Performant** - Smooth, responsive experiences that feel instant.
- **Accessible** - Software should be usable by everyone, regardless of ability.
- **Thoughtful** - Every detail should be intentional and purposeful.

My approach combines modern design trends (like glassmorphism) with timeless UX principles to create applications that are both visually stunning and genuinely useful.
